### FDTD-Absorber

#### Description
A finite difference time domain (FDTD) method written in MATLAB. The goal  is to simulate a fishnet energy absorber working at 1 THz (1000 GHz). Before the transmission and reflection parameters could be derived, the electric field evolution in time domain is simulated. The resonance over a single cell can be discovered through the simulation. 

This code also supports slight modification to make an array device.
